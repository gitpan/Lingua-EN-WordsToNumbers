NAME

Lingua::EN::WordsToNumbers - convert numbers written in English to actual numbers

DESCRIPTION

This module is an OO wrapper for Lingua::EN::Words2Nums, which is very nice, but has an unfortunate name (which doesn't help when you're searching CPAN for modules that turn words into numbers).

INSTALLING

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    
then as root

    ./Build install
    
for a local install, replace the first step with:

    perl Build.PL install_path=lib=/path/to/my/modules/
