NAME

Lingua::EN::WordsToNumbers - convert numbers written in English to actual numbers

DESCRIPTION

This module is a tiny wrapper for Lingua::EN::Words2Nums, which is very nice, but
has an unfortunate name (which doesn't help when you're searching CPAN for
modules that turn words into numbers).

SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::EN::WordsToNumbers qw(words_to_numbers);

    print words_to_numbers("Forty-two");             # "42"

    Lingua::EN::WordsToNumbers->set_debug('y');      # debug mode on
    Lingua::EN::WordsToNumbers->set_debug('n');      # debug mode on

    Lingua::EN::WordsToNumbers->set_billion(10**12); # use "English billion"
